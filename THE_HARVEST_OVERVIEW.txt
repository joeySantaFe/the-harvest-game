THE HARVEST — Project Overview
==============================

WHAT IT IS
----------
"The Harvest" is a browser-based retro arcade game anthology — a single narrative
experience told across three playable acts, each inspired by a classic 1980s arcade
game. It's designed to look and feel like a glowing green-phosphor terminal from a
sci-fi colony ship, complete with CRT scanline effects and procedural audio.

The player is a colonist who has arrived at a distant world. Fuel is the central
resource — it's scarce, shared across all three acts, and every decision about it
matters. Waste fuel in Act I and you'll have fewer lives in Act II.


THE NARRATIVE
-------------
The story unfolds through brief interstitial screens between acts:

ACT I — THE DESCENT (Lunar Lander)
  The colony ships have arrived in orbit. The player's mission is to descend to the
  surface, locate ancient fuel depots, and establish a forward command base. Fuel is
  scarce and must be conserved for the harvest season ahead.

  Gameplay: Physics-based lunar landing. The player pilots a lander through procedural
  terrain, managing thrust and rotation to touch down softly on landing pads near fuel
  depots. Higher-difficulty pads yield more points. The ship takes damage from hard
  landings. After landing, the ship refuels and must lift off to reach the next depot.

ACT II — THE HARVEST (Rip Off)
  Base is secured. But movement is detected on the surface — autonomous mechanical
  collection units are emerging from subsurface structures and moving toward the
  colony's fuel reserves. All hands to defensive positions.

  Gameplay: Top-down arcade defense. The player controls a nimble ship defending fuel
  cells scattered across the screen from waves of enemies. Fuel remaining from Act I
  converts to bonus lives (150 fuel = 1 extra life, max 4 bonus). The game runs through
  3 waves of 4 rounds each, then continues with procedurally scaling difficulty.

  Three enemy types:
    - HARVESTER (red): Seeks fuel cells, attaches to them, and drags them toward the
      screen edge. Shielded from frontal attacks. Flees erratically when hit.
    - SPRINTER (orange): An armed tank with a turret that independently tracks players.
      Patrols the center area with a sweeping turret, then locks on and fires when a
      player enters range. Moves forward only, like a real tank.
    - EXTERMINATOR (purple): Aggressive ramming ship. Charges directly at players.
      Flanks from alternating sides. No ranged weapons — pure aggression.

  Power-ups:
    - SHIELD (cyan): Dropped by destroyed enemies. Grants 15 seconds of invulnerability.
      While shielded, the player can ram enemies to destroy them and push fuel cells
      back toward safety.

  The wave structure introduces enemy types gradually:
    Wave 1: Harvesters only (learning the core mechanic)
    Wave 2: Harvesters + Exterminators (adding melee pressure)
    Wave 3: All three types (full chaos)
    Wave 4+: Procedurally scaled — more enemies, faster speeds

ACT III — THE BATTLE (Battlezone) [NOT YET BUILT]
  The swarm has been neutralized. But deep beneath the surface, something stirs.
  The true conflict is yet to begin.

  Planned gameplay: First-person vector combat inspired by Battlezone. The player
  navigates 3D wireframe battlefields and faces "ancient guardians" — whatever those
  turn out to be. This act exists only as a placeholder screen with "Coming Soon" text.
  The player can currently skip it to reach the victory screen.

VICTORY
  "The harvest has been defended. The mechanical swarm has been neutralized.
   The colony survives another day."
  Displays final fuel and score.


VISUAL STYLE
------------
- Black background with green (#0f0), cyan (#0af), gold (#fd0), and red (#f04) accents
- Monospace font throughout — everything looks like a terminal readout
- CRT scanline overlay effect on the entire screen
- Canvas-rendered gameplay with vector-style graphics (lines, triangles, circles)
- Glowing text effects with animated pulsing
- Act thumbnails on the menu are miniature canvas-rendered scenes showing representative
  gameplay from each act
- The menu has an animated background with blurred, out-of-focus game entities drifting
  slowly across the screen


AUDIO
-----
- Two music tracks: one ambient for menus, one more intense for gameplay
- Music crossfades when transitioning between menu and game states
- Music pauses when the game is paused (ESC key)
- Procedural thruster sound (brown noise through a lowpass filter) for Act I
- Sound effects for landing, refueling, and ambient hum in Act I
- Act II has procedural laser/explosion sounds via Web Audio API oscillators


GAME STRUCTURE & FLOW
---------------------
The app is a state machine:

  MENU --> NARRATIVE (Act I intro) --> ACT I: THE DESCENT
       --> NARRATIVE (Act II intro) --> ACT II: THE HARVEST
       --> ACT III: THE BATTLE --> VICTORY

  At any point, failure sends the player to GAME OVER (high score entry if qualified).

Menu features:
  - Title: "THE HARVEST" in large glowing green text
  - High score display
  - Three act thumbnail cards (locked acts are dimmed with a lock icon)
  - "Archives" button (help/controls reference)
  - "Records" button (high score table)
  - "Reset Act Progress" link (appears when acts are unlocked)

Act unlock system:
  - Act 1 is always available
  - Act 2 unlocks after completing Act 1
  - Act 3 unlocks after completing Act 2
  - Unlocks persist in browser storage between sessions

Debug mode (hold Option/Alt key):
  - All act thumbnails appear unlocked
  - Option+click any thumbnail to jump directly to that act
  - Option+R resets all act progress


CONTROLS
--------
Player 1:
  W or Up Arrow — Thrust
  A/D or Left/Right Arrows — Rotate
  Space — Fire (Act II)
  Mouse click — Fire (Act II, Player 1 only)
  ESC — Pause

Player 2 (co-op, Act II only):
  Arrow Up — Thrust
  Arrow Left/Right — Rotate
  Numpad 0 — Fire

Gamepad support is also implemented for both players.


THE FUEL ECONOMY
----------------
Fuel is THE central mechanic that ties all three acts together:

  Starting fuel: 600
  Fuel-to-lives ratio: 150 fuel = 1 bonus life (max 4 bonus lives)
  Base lives in Act II: 3

So a player who conserves fuel in Act I (say, ending with 500) gets 3 bonus lives
in Act II (3 base + 3 bonus = 6 total lives). A player who wastes fuel (ending with
100) only gets 0 bonus lives (3 base + 0 = 3 total lives).

This creates meaningful tension in Act I — every unnecessary thrust costs lives later.


CO-OP
-----
Act II supports 2-player co-op on the same screen. When 2 players are active, enemy
count scales by 1.5x. Players share the fuel pool and the fate of the colony.


CURRENT STATE (as of v1.2.1, February 2026)
--------------------------------------------
COMPLETE:
  - Act I: The Descent — Fully playable lunar lander with physics, terrain, fuel depots
  - Act II: The Harvest — Fully playable defense game with 3 enemy types, waves, co-op
  - Menu system with thumbnails, unlock progression, high scores
  - Music and sound effects
  - Campaign state (fuel, score, hull) carries between acts

NOT YET BUILT:
  - Act III: The Battle — Currently just a placeholder "Coming Soon" screen
    - Intended to be first-person wireframe vector combat (Battlezone-inspired)
    - Would feature 3D perspective rendering on a 2D canvas
    - Narrative mentions "ancient guardians" beneath the surface
    - No design document or detailed spec exists yet


INSPIRATIONS
------------
  - Lunar Lander (Atari, 1979) — Act I
  - Rip Off (Cinematronics, 1980) — Act II
  - Battlezone (Atari, 1980) — Act III (planned)
  - General aesthetic: early vector arcade games, green phosphor monitors, Alien (1979)
    computer interfaces, sci-fi colony narratives


TONE
----
Serious but spare. The narrative text is terse and functional — like mission briefings
from a colony computer. No humor, no personality in the writing — just information.
The drama comes from the situation itself: you're alone on an alien surface, fuel is
running out, and something mechanical is coming for what little you have left.

The word "harvest" has a double meaning:
  1. The colony's harvest season (gathering fuel to survive)
  2. The machines harvesting/stealing the colony's fuel reserves
