--------------------------------
We have arrived. The scanners are picking up significant mineral density in the crust. The fuel signatures are faint but present.

The journey took more out of the reactor than anticipated. Reserves are at 12%. We cannot sustain orbit for more than 48 hours. We must descend.

I've authorized the deployment of the Lander class vessels. The terrain is jagged—ancient volcanic rock. Pilots have been instructed to conserve fuel at all costs. Every drop we burn landing is a drop we don't have for the dark season.

Godspeed to the descent teams. Do not crash.`

    content: `SURFACE OPERATIONAL REPORT
--------------------------
Touchdown confirmed. Base Alpha foundation laid.

It's quiet down here. Too quiet. The atmosphere is thin, mostly nitrogen and trace argon. The dust settles quickly.

We found the depots mentioned in the probe data. They aren't natural formations. They are geometric. Refined. Someone—or something—stored this fuel here. It's compatible with our drives, but the purity is off the charts.

There is a low-frequency hum coming from beneath the crust. Seismology says it's tectonic, but the rhythm is too regular. It sounds like a heartbeat.`

------------------
Motion detected.
Classification: UNKNOWN.
Origin: SUBSURFACE VENT 4.

Visual confirmation: Mechanical units. Not ours. Red chassis. They are ignoring the perimeter drones and heading straight for the fuel cells.

They are dragging the cells. They are harvesting our reserves.

Mobilizing defense units. Authorization required for weapons free.`

We underestimated them. The red ones—the "Harvesters"—were just workers.

New contacts on radar. Faster. Aggressive. The troops are calling them "Sprinters." They have turrets. They track us. We lost three pilots today.

And the purple ones... suicide units. They don't fire; they just ram. They don't care about their own survival. They only care about destroying us.

We are burning fuel faster than we can secure it. If this continues, we won't have enough to power the life support for the winter.`

[DATA CORRUPTED]
[REQ SECURITY LEVEL 5]

...it's a hive...
...geometrical guardians...
...wireframe projection...

The structure below is alive. Not organic—mechanical. A network of corridors carved from bedrock, lined with circuitry older than our civilization. The walls pulse with the same frequency as the surface hum.

At the center, something waits. It knows we are here.

-----------------
All surface operations concluded.

The mechanical swarm has been neutralized. The hive is silent. Fuel reserves secured—enough to sustain the colony through the dark season.

But the question remains: who built the depots? Who programmed the guardians? And why did they stop?

The hum beneath the crust has ceased. For the first time since landing, there is silence.

Commander Vance has ordered all data sealed under Level 5 encryption. Whatever we found down there... the colony isn't ready to know.

Not yet.
