THE HARVEST - VERSION CHANGELOG
================================

V30 - LUNAR LANDER + RIP OFF (FULL CAMPAIGN)
---------------------------------------------
Major Update: Three-Act Structure Implemented

NEW: ACT I - LUNAR LANDER (Chapters 1-2)
-----------------------------------------
Game Structure:
- Full Campaign Mode: Lunar Lander → Rip Off (narrative arc)
- Quick Start Mode: Jump directly to Rip Off (arcade mode)
- Fuel and score carry over from Lunar Lander to Rip Off
- Remaining fuel determines starting lives in Rip Off (0-4 bonus)

Physics Engine - dt-Based (Frame-Rate Independent):
- Delta-time integration: stable across all frame rates
- Gravity: 0.576 px/s² (Ch1), 0.864 px/s² (Ch2) - 20% reduced from original
- All values in consistent units (pixels/sec, radians/sec)
- Smooth 60fps on modern hardware, stable on slower systems

Momentum-Driven Controls:
- Angular momentum: rotation has inertia + damping
- Angular acceleration: 8.0 rad/s² (0.2-0.4s spin-up time)
- Ramping throttle: smooth [0..1] throttle response
- Thrust scales with throttle (not binary on/off)
- Fuel consumption scales with throttle intensity
- Thrust flame length/brightness scales with throttle
- Thrust sound frequency increases with throttle

Side-Scrolling Camera:
- World coordinates: terrain/pads in world space
- Dead zone: 200px from screen center (no micro-scrolling)
- Camera only moves when lander exceeds threshold
- Smooth following: ship stays generally centered
- Parallax starfield for depth perception
- No horizontal wrap (removed)

Procedural Terrain Generation:
- Chunk-based: 20 segments per chunk, extends as you fly
- Seeded RNG: reproducible terrain per chapter
- Goal distance: 8+ screens to extraction point
- Geometric hints: flat sections, regular patterns (foreshadowing)
- Terrain culling: only renders visible segments

Vertical Terrain Structures (Classic Lunar Lander):
- Tall vertical mountains: 200-400px cliff faces (15% chance)
- Deep narrow valleys: 150-300px drops (10% chance)
- Plateaus with geometric patterns (10% chance)
- Normal terrain variation (65% chance)
- Landing pads placed on:
  • Flat valley floors
  • Carved cliff shelves
  • Narrow plateau tops
- Full vertical range: 15-95% of screen height
- No overhangs (terrain remains function of X)
- Vertical control as important as horizontal travel

Dynamic Camera Zoom (Precision Enhancement):
- Base zoom: 1.0 (normal view)
- Close zoom: 1.8 (precision view)
- Zoom triggers (cumulative):
  • Altitude < 150px: smooth zoom based on proximity
  • Near steep walls (>100px height): zoom factor 0.6
  • Near landing pads (<250px): zoom factor 0.8
- Smooth interpolation: exponential smoothing (rate: 3.0)
- Zoom scales around ship position (no camera jump)
- Physics unchanged: zoom affects rendering only
- Benefits:
  • Improved precision during landing
  • Better visibility in tight canyons
  • Fairer collision detection feel
  • Classic Lunar Lander authenticity

Landing Pads & Fuel Collection:
- Safe landing pads every ~1.5 screens
- Fuel pads every ~3 screens (ensures feasible run)
- Landing safety checks: velocity + angle requirements
  • Vertical velocity limit: 120 px/s (Ch1), reduced in Ch2
  • Horizontal velocity limit: 90 px/s (Ch1)
  • Angle tolerance: 0.3 radians from upright
- Fuel collection: +30% per fuel pad (up to 100% max)
- Visual distinction:
  • Regular pads: cyan markers, "SAFE" label
  • Fuel pads: blinking cyan beacons, "FUEL" label
  • Extraction pad: blinking orange beacon, "EXTRACTION" label
- Collected pads turn gray (no re-collection)

Extraction Point (Level End):
- Distinct final landing zone at goal distance
- Blinking orange beacon for visibility
- Score bonus: 2000 base + 20×fuel remaining
- Successful landing advances to next chapter/cutscene

Lunar Lander HUD:
- Fuel gauge: visual bar + percentage (color warnings at 40%/20%)
- Altitude: distance to terrain directly below
- Vertical velocity: with color-coded warnings
- Horizontal velocity: with color-coded warnings
- Score accumulator
- Chapter indicator

Navigation Beacon:
- Orange arrow indicator (top-right corner)
- Distance to extraction point in meters
- Always visible during flight
- Updates in real-time

Narrative Cutscenes:
- Intro: Mission briefing (before Ch1)
- Post-Ch1: Surface observations, unusual geometry
- Post-Ch2: Discovery of the swarm (transition to Rip Off)
- Press any key to continue
- Lem-style contemplative tone

Visual & Audio:
- Thrust particles scale with throttle intensity
- Particle physics: dt-based with gravity
- Floating "+30 FUEL" popup on collection
- Landing feedback: success tones or crash explosion
- Screen shake on crash (intensity: 20)
- Parallax starfield scrolls with camera
- Chapter-specific settings (gravity, goal distance)

Technical Implementation:
- Single-file architecture maintained (1795 lines)
- Scene manager: MENU → CUTSCENE → LUNAR_LANDER → RIP_OFF
- FloatingText class supports world/screen coords
- Terrain extends procedurally (no pre-generation)
- Camera dead-zone prevents jitter
- Consistent vector graphics style

Controls:
- Thrust: Up Arrow / W / Space (hold for continuous)
- Rotate: Left/Right Arrows or A/D
- Gamepad: full support with analog stick
- Same control config system as Rip Off

ACT II - RIP OFF (Chapters 3+)
